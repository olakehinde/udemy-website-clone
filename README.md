# udemy-website-clone
A clone of the Udemy website's home page built with Bootstrap 4.
I decided to learn and explore Bootstrap 4, so as to improve on my frontend and design skills. 
I got a Bootstrap4 tutorial (I must say, it is quite very good and comprehensive) by Dave Partner,
you should check him out on YouTube and Udemy (He's too good).
Now, I can confidently say, I am well equipped to use Bootstrap 4 for my coming projects.

Please,click on the "STAR" icon so this project can reach more people.
I am also open to suggestions for improvement.

Thank you.
